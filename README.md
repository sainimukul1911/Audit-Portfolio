# Audit Portfolio

Welcome to my Audit Portfolio! This repository showcases my work in auditing both core blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts. The repository is separated into smart contracts and blockchain infra.
This portfolio is organized to reflect the depth and breadth of my experience. Here is my immunefi profile link https://immunefi.com/profile/gladiator111 .

## Overview

I have a diverse background in auditing, specializing in:

- **Core Blockchain Infrastructure**: Security assessments, code analysis, and architecture review.
- **Smart Contracts**: Vulnerability identification, proof-of-concept exploits, and best practice recommendations.

This portfolio is organized to reflect the depth and breadth of my experience. Each project folder includes detailed reports, proofs-of-concept (POCs), and additional analysis.
